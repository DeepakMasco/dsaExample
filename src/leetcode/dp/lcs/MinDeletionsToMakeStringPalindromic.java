/*
* Given a string 'str' of size ‘n’. The task is to remove or delete the minimum number of characters from the string so that the resultant string is a palindrome. Find the minimum numbers of characters we need to remove.
Note: The order of characters should be maintained.

Example 1:

Input: n = 7, str = "aebcbda"
Output: 2
Explanation: We'll remove 'e' and
'd' and the string become "abcba".
*
*
* We can see this question as LCS variation. To make a string palindromic we first need to find the longest palindromic subsequence
* we can do that using revere os string and then finding LCS and then ans would be
* N - LCS Length = Deletion required.
*
* This can be also used in to find min no of insertions.
* As the char we are deleting are not having any duplicate elemnts to make it palindrome.
* So either we can remove those or add same amount of char to make it palindrome.
