* We are given a sorted array we need to find the element which gives min difference from the key.
* It means if element is presnet then we should return the same if not we should do - from the neighbour elements
* and then the min one we will return.
*   1,2,3,4,5,8   key = 6
*  6-5 = 1 , 8-6 = 2. Hence ans is 5 as the diff is 1 and this is min,
