public class IntersectionOf2LinkedList {

/*

Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect.
 If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.

    Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
    Output: Intersected at '8'
    Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
    From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5].
    There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
